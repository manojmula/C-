 * What is gametheory?
 * Defination:the study of strategically interdependent behaviour 
 * strategic interdepndence :what i do your outcomes and what you do effects my outcomes
 * not just about winning and losing though it could be
 * 
 * Why game theory
 * the logic of strategically interdependent situations get extremely complicated extrmeely fast
 * Game theory gives us acccounting tools
 * Game theory allows ud to quickly draw parallels from one situation to another
 * this will allow yyou to think on your feetmuch better than you can today
 * Topics:simultaneous move games
 * Example soccer penalty kicks prison interrogattion
 * decing wheather to stop or drive at a stoplight
 * 
 * Items covered :Strict dominance,iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies
 * pure strategy nash equilibruim
 * best response mixed strategy nash eqquilibruim
 * Weak diominance
 * 
 * chapter 2
 * Topic:Game where players take turns moving
 * Example war invasion plans police search
 * 
 * Items covered back induction sub game
 * perfect quilibrium,crediblle threats 
 * tyinng hands,commitment probleems,forward indduction
 * 
 * 
 * Chapter 3: Advanced forms of games
 * Topic:everything from chapter 1 except generalized
 * Example:Dose a triker kick left more frequently as his accuracy improves on the left side
 * Items covered:Comparative statics,knife edge equiibria and symmetric zerosum game
 * 
 * Pre requisite
 * Game theory is logically demandinf but rarely requires more than high school algebra
 * It will help if you have a semisters worth of calculus
 * if you dont have will miss 5% of the course
 * 
 * GAMETHEORY 101:The prisoners Dilema and strict Dominance
 * 
 * The situation:
 * Two suspects are arrested
 * the police think that they were trying to rob a store
 * But the cops can only prove that the suspects were trespassing 
 * Thus the police need one of the criminals to rat out the other
 * 
 * The potential deal
 * If one confesses to robory the police can only charge the prisonoer for tresspassing
 * Panishment : 1 month in jail wach
 * If one confessess and other dose not the police will be lenient on the rat and severly punish the quit one
 * punishment :12 month jail for quite one and 0 months for the rat
 * If both confess the police punish both of them equally 
 * 8months in jail
 * Supposse the theives only want to minimize the number of months they spend in jain 
 * shoulld they confess to the police
 * 
 * Iterated Elimination of strictly Dominated Strategies
 * This process is called IESDS
 * If you ever see a strictly dominated strategies eliminate it imidetly
 * order dose not matter
 * If IESDS leads to a single outcome you will arrive at that outcome wheather you eeliminate 
 * strategies 1 or 2 first
