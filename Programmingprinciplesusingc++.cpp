 * Programming is the art of expressing solutions to the problems that a computer can execute those 
 * full solutions
 * much of the efffort in programming is spent finding and refining the solutions
 * Ofetrn a problem is only fully understood through process of programming osolution to it
 * this book is for someone who has never programmed bfore but is willing to work hard to learn 
 * it helps you to understand the principles and acqquire the skills the practicle skills of programming usingg the c++
 * programming language.My aim is for you to gaun the sufficient knowlege and experience to perform simple useful programming
 * tasks using the best up to date techniquws
 * How long will it take>?
 * as part of the first year university course you can work through book in a semister assuming that 
 * you have worklioad of four to five courses of average difficulty
 * if you work by yourself you dont expect to spend less tim e tan that may be 15 hours for 15 weeks
 * 
 * three months may seem to be long time but there is lot to learn and you will be writing your first simple programs
 * after an about hour
 * also all learninfg is gradual
 * each chapter
 * 
 * Computers people and programming
 * int this chapter we will present some of the things that we think make programming important intresting and fun
 * we also present a few funcdamental ideas and ideals
 * we hope to debunk a cople of popular myths about programming and programmers
 * this is a chapter to skim for now and to return a later when you are struggling with some programming
 * problem and wondering if its all worth
 * Introduntion
 * software
 * people
 * computer scieence
 * computers are everywhere
 * screens and no screens
 * shipping
 * telecommunications
 * medicine
 * information
 * a vertical view 
 * so what 
 * ideals for programmer
 * Introducntion 
 * like most of learninf learning how to program is a chicken and egg problem we want to get started
 * but we also want to know why what we are about to learn matters
 * we want to learn practicle skills but also make sure it is not just a passing fasd
 * we want to know that we are not going to waste our time but dont want to be bored by stillmore hype and moralizing 
 * for now just read as much of this chapter seems to be intresting and come back later when you feel the need of refreshing 
 * your mrmory of why the techniue details matter outside the classroom
 * this chapter is personal statment of what we find intresting and important about programming
 * it explains what motivates us to keep going in this firld after ddecaded 
 * this is a chapter to read to get an idea of possible ultimate goals and an idea of what kind of persona  programmer might be
 * a beginers technique book inevitably contains much prertty basic stuff
 * 
 * our civilization runs on software improving software and findding new users for software are two
 * of the ways an individdual can helo improve the lives of many
 * Programming plays an esseential in that
 * 
 * Software
 * Good software is invisible.You cant see it feel it or knock on it
 * software is a collection of prrograms running on some computer 
 * sometimes we can see the computer 
 * often we see only something that contains the computer such as telephone cmera bread maker
 * a car or a wind turbine
 * we can see what that softwre dose
 * we can be annoyed or be hurt if itdosent do of what it is supposded to do 
 * we can be annoyed or hurt if it is upposed to do dosen meet our needs
