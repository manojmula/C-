/******
 * In c++ the IO system is designed to work with different IO devices 
 * The IO system supplies an interfierence called stream to the programmer which is independednt 
 * of the actual device being used
 * A stream is a sequence of bytes and servees as a source or destination stream the recives outpur
 * fom the program is called ouput stream
 * the c++ Io system contains hierarchy of stream classes used for input and output operations
 * These classes are declared in the header iostream
 * 
 * The c++ IO system contains a hierarchy of stream classes used for input ad ouput operations
 * these classes are declared in the headder file iostream
 * 
 * cin represents the input stream connected to the standard input device and cout
 * respresents the output stream connected to standard output decvice
 * The istrean and osstream classes define two member functions get() and put() to handle 
 * the single character IO
 * operations
 * the >> operatr is overloaded in the istream class as an extraction operator and << operator is 
 * overloaded as an insertion operator
 * We can read and write a line of text more effiecitly using the line oriended IO 
 * functions getline() and write() respectively
 * The IOS class contains the memeber functions such as width(),precision(),fill(),set()
 * and unset() to format the output
 * The headder file iomanip provides a set of manipulators functions to manipulate output formates
 * They provide featires as the of ios class functions
 * we can design our own manipulators for certain purposes
