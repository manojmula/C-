 * what is inheritance?
 * why is it useful?
 * terminology and notation
 * inheritance vs composition
 * deriving classes from existing classes
 * types of inheritance
 * protected members and class
 * access
 * Constructors and destructors
 * passing arguments to base class constructor
 * order of constructor and destructor classes
 * redefining base class methods
 * class hierarchies
 * multiple inheritanc
 * 
 * what is inheritance?
 * Providdes a method for creating new classes from existing classes
 * the new classes contains the data and behaviour of the existing class
 * allow for reuse of existing classes
 * allow us to focus on the common attributes among the set of classes
 * allows new classes to modify behaviourrs of existing classes to make it unique
 * without actually moddiying the original class
 * 
 * Inheritance
 * process of creating new classes from existing classes
 * reuse mechanism
 * single inheritance
 * a new class is cretead from another single class
 * multiple inheritance
 * a new class is created from(two) or more other classes
 * 
 * Base class(parent class or super class)
 * derived class(child class,sub class)
 * The class being created from the base class
 * "is a relationship"
 * Public inheritance
 * derived classes are sub-type of thier base class
 * can use a derived class object whenevr we use a base class object
 * 
 * generelization
 * combining similar classes into a single ,more generic class based on common attributes
 * Specialization
 * creating new classes from existing classes providing more specialized attributes or operation
 * Inheritance or class Hierarchies
 * Organization of our inheritance relationships
 * inheritance vs composition
 * public inheritance vs composition
 * Both allow reuse of the existing classes
 * public inheritance
 * is a relation ship
 * Employee is a person
 * checking account is a account
 * circle is a shape
 * composition has a relationship
 * person has a account
 * player has a special attack
 * circle has a location
 * Deriving classes from existing classes
 * c++ derivation sintax
 * class Base{
 * };
 * class Derived :: access-specifier Base{
 * };
 * Access specifier are noting but that controls the accessing of membr data or member function
 * types of inheritance in c++
 * public
 * Most common 
 * Establishes is a relationship between Derived and base classes
 * private and protected
 * Establishes derived class has a base class relationship
 * is implemented in terms of relationship
 * Different from composition
 *
