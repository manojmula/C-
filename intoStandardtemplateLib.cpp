 * what is stl
 * ???
 * standard programming library
 * 
 * Standardd template library
 * a library of powerful ,reusable,adaptable,generic classes and functions
 * implemented using c++ template
 * implements common data structure and algorithms
 * huge class library
 * aaleexander stepanov(1994)
 * why use stl
 * Assortment of commonly used containers
 * known time and size complexity
 * tried and tested -reusability
 * consisstent,fast and type safe
 * extensible
 * STL has three main components
 * containers
 * collection of objects or primitive types
 * (array,vector,dequw,stack,set,map etc)
 * Algorithms
 * functions for processing sequencees of elements from containers
 * find,max,count,accumilate,sort,etc
 * iterators
 * generate sequence of elements from containers
 * forward reverse by value by reference constant
 * 
 * std::accumitale(v.bigin,v.end);
 * 
 * type of containers in stl
 * there are three types of containers in stl
 * sequence containers
 * array,vector,list,forward_list,deque
 * 
 * associative containers
 * set,multti set,map,multimap
 * 
 * container adaptares
 * stack,queue,priorrity qeue
 * 
 * Types of adapters
 * Input iterators- from the container to the program
 * output iterators
 * from the program to the container
 * forwarard iterators navigate onee item at a time in one direction
 * Bi-directional iterators
 * navigate one item at a time both directions
 * random access iterators-directly access a container items
 * 
 * types of algorithms in stls
 * about 60algorithm in stl
 * non-modifying algorithm
 * modifying algorithm
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * generic programming and templates
 * Generic programming
 * "writing code that works with variety of types as arguments,
 * as long as those argument types meet speccific syntatctic and semantic requirements",
 * Bjarne stroustrup
 * 
 * macros be awar
 * function templates
 * class templates
 * 
 * 
 * how macros work itseems
 * macros are #define
 * c++ preprocessor directives
 * no type information
 * simple substitution
 * #define max_size 100
 * #define Pi 3.14159
 * 
 * #define MAX(a,b)((a>b)?a:b)
 * 
 * Now this vido is going to tell about the functional teemplates
